          <p>
            As a mid-level developer with a strong background in React and associated technologies, I thrive on solving complex problems and building engaging user experiences. I've also taught Python and enjoyed guiding others through their coding journey.

            When I'm not coding, you can find me kayaking or exploring new environments, always on the lookout for the next adventure. My passion for technology extends beyond the screenâ€”I'm dedicated to sharing my knowledge and fostering growth in the tech community.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to leverage my skills to create innovative solutions and contribute to exciting projects. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate!
